I have to say that I was disappointed when I opened up the package containing my iPod wallet.
It's cute, but not $60ish cute.
First of all, it's not leather, it's nylon.
The lining is indeed suede, but the photos in the product listing are misleading.
I'm keeping it because the hassle of shipping it back, etc. isn't worth it.
It does the job, but it wasn't what I was expecting.
I feel ripped off
